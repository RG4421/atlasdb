    As part of implementing lock watching, snapshot transactions now use a new endpoint on the timelock server to obtain commit timestamps along with lock watch updates. As part of enabling this work, the following dev breaks were introduced:

    - PrecommitCondition has been replaced by PrecommitConditionWithWatches. We provided a utility method to adapt existing PrecommitConditions if lock watch information is not needed
    - The deprecated TransactionManager. runTaskWithConditionWithRetry method using Guava suppliers has been removed
    - TransactionManager interface now must implement a getLockWatchManager() method. This can be delegated to the timelock service by using `NotWatchingLockWatchManager` until your product wants to use lock watches (which are not yet fully implemented anyway).
