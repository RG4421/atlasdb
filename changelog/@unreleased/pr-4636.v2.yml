  description: 'As part of implementing lock watching, snapshot transactions now use
    a new endpoint on the timelock server to obtain commit timestamps along with lock
    watch updates. PrecommitConditions can now be expressed in terms of commit updates,
    allowing for verification of conditions relating to watched locks that have been
    taken out by others since the start of the transaction. '
