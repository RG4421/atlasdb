  description: |-
    Bump Atlas retry timeout to 15 seocnds

    **Goals (and why)**:
    PDS-111849 - caused by Timelock being down for >10 seconds during a leader election. Increasing this retry timeout to 15 seconds should vastly reduce the chance of there being a problem.

    **Implementation Description (bullets)**:
    Changed hard-coded variable from 10 to 15 seconds

    **Testing (What was existing testing like?  What have you done to improve it?)**:
    N/A

    **Concerns (what feedback would you like?)**:
    Verify that there are no other places where this limit needs to be changed.

    **Where should we start reviewing?**:
    `FastFailoverProxy`

    **Priority (whenever / two weeks / yesterday)**:
    Today
