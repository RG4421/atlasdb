    ``CheckAndSetCompatibility#SUPPORTED_NO_DETAIL`` has been removed; all key-value services are now expected to return information about why check-and-set or put-unless-exists operations failed.

    DbKVS now returns details about failures to perform check-and-set or put-unless-exists operations.
    Previously, a ``KeyAlreadyExistsException`` thrown from DbKVS did not have any information on existing keys; a ``CheckAndSetException`` thrown from a failed attempt to check-and-set an empty value did not include the value that was already present.
